title: Forwarded ports from a VM don't work?

If you're running a process that listens on localhost in a Docker container/VM/..., and you want to access it from the outside world but it doesn't work (even if forwarding works correctly), try explicitly setting the process host to 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1. That may or may not fix it.
