title: Weird blocking behaviour when using custom Java Input-/OutputStreams (eg. in conjunction with scanners)

Java Scanners (and other classes) use buffering behind the scenes. Therefore, when experiencing unexpected blocking when using custom Java Input-/OutputStreams, additionally override the `read(byte[], int, int)` and `write(byte[], int, int)` methods along with their no-argument variants. Counter-intuitively, these may return less bytes than requested (but at least one), without blocking. However, the default implementation does not make use of that. Therefore, buffers use them to do non-blocking buffer reads.

Additionally, you might want to consider overriding `flush()` and `available()`, but these seem to be of lesser significance.
