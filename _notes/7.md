title: Nested Promises in JavaScript
date: June 9th, 2019

In JavaScript, nested promises will automatically be flattened by `.then` and `await`: `await Promise.resolve(Promise.resolve(5)) === 5`. This will cause issues with asynchronous methods taking generic values; as they will behave different if they take a Promise than with any other object.

For example, take the following method:

```javascript
async function identity(t) {
    return t;
}
```

With this method, we would expect the following assertion to always be truthy:

```javascript
alert(obj === await identity(obj));
```

And that is the case... unless `obj` is a Promise. This means that generic asynchronous data structures are unable to deal with Promises, and TypeScript sometimes fails to be typesafe:

```typescript
async function identity<T>(t: T): Promise<T> {
    return t;
}

identity(Promise.resolve(5)).then((val: number) => alert(val))
```

Even if the `val` is a number because `.then` flattens the Promise, TypeScript does not recognize it as such:

```typescript
Argument of type '(val: number) => void' is not assignable to parameter of type '(value: Promise<number>) => void | PromiseLike<void>'.
  Types of parameters 'val' and 'value' are incompatible.
    Type 'Promise<number>' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```

This design decision was likely made so we only need `.then` (takes object or Promise) and not `.then` (takes object) and `.flatThen` (takes Promise). Which is an understandable position for convenience, however there are better alternatives; if the callback of `.then` were to expect `Promise<T>`, but simply wrap any values that are not in a Promise into one, we wouldn't get full type safety, but we'd get the convenience of a single `.then` method, but still allow us to create asynchronous data structure that may contain any objects, including Promises.

```javascript
assert(await 5 === 5); // always succeeds
assert(await Promise.resolve(5) === 5); // always succeeds
assert(await Promise.resolve(Promise.resolve(5)) === 5); // succeeds with JavaScript's Promises, fails in ours
assert(await someObj === someObj); // fails in both definitions if someObj is a Promise; no full type safety
assert(await Promise.resolve(someObj) === someObj); // succeeds with our Promises, fails in JavaScript's if someObj is a Promise
```

With this alternative Promise definition, languages like TypeScript could get around type errors by simply disallowing (as a warning or compiler flag) `await`ing anything that's not a guaranteed Promise at compile-time.
